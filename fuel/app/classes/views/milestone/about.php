      <p class="bio1"><b>Claire Cortesy</b><br> I am a senior Computer Science Major with a minor in film studies at Colorado State University.
      Over the summer I had to make a website for a club event. I was limited by the functionality of the web design application I was using 
      and became frustrated. So I decided to take CS 312 so that if I was ever asked to work on a website again I had the tools to make it look and function exactly as I desired.</p>

      <p><b>Michael Cucina</b><br> I am a senior in Computer Science set to graduate in Fall 2023. I'm taking this course to learn more about modern web development
    and some of the best practices currently in use. I'm excited to graduate this year and enter the industry with the knowledge and experience I've accrued during my time at CSU. </p>

      <p><b>Soonho Kwon</b><br> I am a senior undergraduate Biology major at Colorado State University who is interested in analyzing genetic 
      data to find relationships between genes that could be the cause for genetic diseases. I am interested in learning web design and development 
      to have a platform to display analyzed data.</p>

      <p><b>Ashaka Pathak</b><br> An Economics major with minor in Computer Science at Colorado State University. I have volunteered for multiple
        non-profits, helping them save up to over $$10,000. I have a strong interest in design everywhere, and web design is no exception. I know
        that once I get the hang of this, I'll take a great deal of pride in knowing how to make websites from scratch. </p>
