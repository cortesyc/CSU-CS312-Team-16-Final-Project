      <p class="bio1"><b>Claire Cortesy</b><br> I am a senior Computer Science Major with a minor in film studies at Colorado State University.
      Over the summer I had to make a website for a club event. I was limited by the functionality of the web design application I was using 
      and became frustrated. So I decided to take CS 312 so that if I was ever asked to work on a website again I had the tools to make it look and function exactly as I desired.</p>
